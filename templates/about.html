           <h2>About Stock Predictor</h2>
           <p>
               
            WELCOME TO STOCK PREDICTION APP:
            <br>
            Welcome to our Stock Prediction App, where we harness the power of cutting-edge deep learning models to forecast stock prices for given no of days. Our application aims to provide users with valuable insights into potential price trends, empowering them to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of stock trading.
            <br>
            HOW IT WORKS:
            <br>
            Our Stock Prediction App combines the prowess of deep learning techniques with historical stock price data to predict future price movements. By leveraging advanced encoders, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and other powerful algorithms, we create robust predictive models capable of capturing intricate patterns and trends in the stock market.
            <br>
            HOW IS DATA COLLECTED:
            <br>
            To ensure accuracy and reliability, we source historical stock prices from the trusted Yahoo Finance API. This API enables us to access a vast repository of stock market data, including price histories, trading volumes, and other essential financial indicators.
            <br>
            HOW IS DATA PREPROCESSED:
            <br>
            Before feeding the data into our deep learning models, we undertake a rigorous data preprocessing phase. During this stage, we clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the features to ensure consistency and eliminate biases. Preprocessing plays a pivotal role in optimizing model performance and generating more precise predictions.
            <br>
            MODELS USED:
            <br>
            Our Stock Prediction App employs state-of-the-art deep learning models, including encoders, LSTM, GRU, and other cutting-edge architectures. These models are carefully selected and fine-tuned to extract intricate temporal patterns and dependencies from historical stock price data. By combining the strengths of these models, we strive to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.
            <br>
            OUTPUT:
            <br>
            Once the deep learning models process the historical data and learn from the underlying patterns, our Stock Prediction App generates a comprehensive forecast for the stock price over no of days user entered. Please note that while our predictions are based on historical trends and sophisticated algorithms, the stock market is inherently volatile and subject to various external factors. As such, we urge users to use the predictions as supplementary information and exercise their own judgment when making investment decisions.
            
            Disclaimer: Our Stock Prediction App does not guarantee profits or financial gains. All investment decisions carry inherent risks, and users should conduct their research and seek professional advice before making any investments.
            
            Remember, the stock market is highly unpredictable, and past performance does not necessarily guarantee future results. We hope that our Stock Prediction App provides you with valuable insights and serves as a useful tool in your journey through the dynamic world of stock trading. Happy investing!
